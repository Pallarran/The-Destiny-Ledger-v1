# The Destiny Ledger - Development Plan

## Project Overview
The Destiny Ledger is a browser-based D&D 5e character optimizer with DPR simulation, character comparison, and level path optimization. The app features a modern-fantasy UI with parchment panels, dark chrome, and arcane blue accents.

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Early Deployment** (Week 1-2)

#### Week 1: Project Setup
1. **Project Scaffolding**
   - Initialize Vite + React 18 + TypeScript project
   - Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme tokens
   - Set up shadcn/ui component library
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest

2. **Design System Implementation**
   - Implement CSS custom properties from spec (colors, shadows, etc.)
   - Create base components: `Panel`, `RuneCorners`, `ChartFrame`
   - Set up Google Fonts (Cinzel, Cormorant Garamond, Inter)
   - Build core layout components with parchment styling

3. **Basic Layout & Navigation**
   - Set up React Router with main routes
   - Create app shell with dark chrome header/sidebar
