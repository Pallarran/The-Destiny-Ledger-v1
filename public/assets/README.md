# Fantasy Assets

To complete the fantasy theme transformation, place the following assets in this directory:

1. **ornate-frame.png** - The decorative frame from the concept image (the ornate border design)
2. **parchment-texture.png** - The parchment texture background from the concept image

These images should be saved from the provided concept designs to achieve the authentic fantasy aesthetic.

## Asset Requirements

- ornate-frame.png: Should be a high-resolution PNG with transparent background
- parchment-texture.png: Should be a seamless tileable texture for use as CSS background

Once these assets are added, the fantasy theme will be complete with ornate frames around major UI sections and authentic parchment textures throughout the application.
